# 💬 Hate Speech Detection using Logistic Regression

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression classifier. The model is trained using TF-IDF vectorization and evaluated on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled tweets:
- `train.csv` — used for training the model.
- `test.csv` — used for testing predictions.

## 🛠️ Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression Model
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)
- Model and Vectorizer Exported as `.pkl` files

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/Auromirajayakumar/Hate-Speech-Detection.git
cd Hate-Speech-Detection
2. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the script:

## 📷 Output
- Displays accuracy and evaluation report
- Shows confusion matrix
- Saves trained model and vectorizer
